# BUSTED[S]
A repo with data, scripts and information associated with the forthcoming BUSTED[S] publication. 

## HBL
includes **BUSTED-SRV-sim.bf** the script used to generate simulation replicates.

**batch_script.sh** an example of the slurm batch script used to run simulation replicates through BUSTED an BUSTED[S]

## Data
includes original examples of data and results jsons from BUSTED[S]

**paper_LFs** includes likelihood function batch files (.LF.bf) used to generate the 16 sequence and 31 sequence simulation replicates in the paper as well as newick trees for both when omega = 1.

**BUSTED-SRV sim parameters - Inputs for sims.csv** shows the naming convention and parameter values used for each simulation of 100 replicants. Due to size limitations on github actual sequences will be hosted on silverback (TBD).
